The source code is contestant squark's solution of Q1 of the Google codejam 2017 final. Default OCLint options were used to analyze
the code.
In the directory, type the following command to see the report analysis:

	oclint A.cpp -- -c

The results are attached to the end of this file as appendix.

OCLint puts an hiearchy over the types of violations in the code, ranked by priority 1, 2 and 3. There is no priority 1 violations
in the source code. Three P2 violations were found: cyclomatic complexity, non-commenting source statements and N-path complexity,
all of which points to the line 72 in the source code, which is the beginning line of function main().

Cyclomatic complexity is the indictor of 'if', 'while', 'for' and 'case' in a function, and N-path indicates the number of possible 
execution paths within one function. The non-commenting source statements counts the number of lines of a function excluding the
brackets, comments etc. All of these could be reduced through dividing up large block of code within one function, and the source 
code indeed did not have functions other than main(), which made the main() function a bit complicated.

The results are understandable considering that the code was written under time limits for demanding questions.

Priority 3 violations are basically stylistic checks. The code has a lot of short variable names, which indeed made the code hard to
read, and has one unused variable.
